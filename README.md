# Smart Agriculture and Precision Farming System

## Overview
The Smart Agriculture and Precision Farming System is designed to enhance agricultural practices through the use of technology. This system enables farmers to monitor crops, livestock, and environmental conditions to optimize resource usage and improve yields. It leverages IoT sensors, weather services, and data analytics to provide actionable insights for modern farming.

## Features
- **Crop Monitoring**: Monitor the health and status of crops using sensor data.
- **Livestock Monitoring**: Keep track of livestock health and RFID data for better management.
- **Irrigation Management**: Adjust irrigation based on soil moisture levels and weather forecasts.
- **Weather Forecasting**: Integrate weather data to make informed decisions on farming activities.
- **Greenhouse Control**: Manage climate conditions within greenhouses for optimal plant growth.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
